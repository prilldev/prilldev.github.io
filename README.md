<h3>Prill Kidz Minecraft Server - Bedrock Edition on prilldudez.net</h3>

<strong>[Server: mcbedrock.prilldudez.net<br>Port: 19132](https://mcbedrock.prilldudez.net)</strong><br>
*If the server is currently Not Online in Minecraft for Windows, clicking the link will open a blank web page which will NOT load, but the act of requesting the URL initiates the minecraft server startup process. Wait about 5 minutes and the server should be available in Minecraft for Windows (or any Bedrock edition-compatible console or device).*
